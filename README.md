# Giphy-API
Using Giphy API to populate a page of book character-themed gifs.  

## Motivation
Emphasis on making API calls to Giphy to return static images as well as gifs, and using jQuery to render content on the fly/ attach event handlers to dynamically-rendered content.

## Instructions
Click on a pre-populated button to load gifs; an API call to giphy's API will return the gifs most closely-related to the button's search terms. <br />
Users can also enter their own character search terms to render a new jQuery button on the fly.   <br />
Clicking on different buttons will trigger API calls and render the returned gifs.  Gifs are returned as a static image, but can be clicked to make them active.

## Credits
Thank you to Giphy for the great gifs!
